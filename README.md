## Prerequisites

* You need Node installed

## Get started

* Install: `npm i`
* Run with local development server (localhost:3000): `npm start`
* Build (requires web server): `npm run build`

To run the build locally, you need to run a web server. An easy way to achieve this is with:

* `npm i -g serve`
* `serve -s build`
